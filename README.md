# Proxy-Forward

A simple script to be run on a compromised machine with an internal network that creates a proxy to ports within other machines on the network and generates a command for port forwarding to an attacker's local machine.

Or it could just be used to access services on a VPS without exposing it to the internet (proxy part not needed) or in any way you see fit

## Requirements
